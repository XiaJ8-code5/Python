# Python3 learning (17 Jan 2021)

*<h4>Scripts I wrote while learning python3</h4>*

Hi, this repo includes all the scripts I wrote while learning **Python3**.

I would like thank my wife, who introduced **R and Python** to me and supported me in learning them.

Also my cute cat **Zuki**, who is now 3 yrs old (as I write this README), for all the emotional supports.!
